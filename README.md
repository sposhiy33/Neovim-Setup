This is my setup for neovim. This repository is mainly meant to quickly migrate my neovim setup to any new Ubuntu systems I may be using.

Note: this setup was done on an AMD system running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Usage:
  - Download neovim
  - within the ``~/.config`` folder, clone this repo
  - open neovim to begin installation of all plugins
